\begin{abstract}
  This physics Investigation is called "Determining the Goldilocks Zone for 10 stars of different types". During this investigation, I will pick 10 random stars of different types: White Dwarfs, Red Giants, Main-Sequence Stars and Blue Supergiants. I will research the stars in terms of luminosty, radius and the length of Goldilock Zones, more known as Circumferential Habitable Zones. For the sake of demonstration, I have written several programs and simulations to support my investigation.

\section{Inroduction}

Soon, our Mother-Star, Sun will make the poles of Earth a tropical paradise and later on destroy all the life on Earth. Our star is the typical member of medium-sized main-sequence stars, nothing interesting or extraordinary about it. Only that it is the only known star to host life. Because of gravitational pull, a cosmic gas cloud started to contract and later under the heavy influence of gravity, the center of the gas cloud increases in pressure and active fusion processes start to happen.
