  This Physics Investigation is aimed at research of the relationship between galaxy rotation and visible matter. Therefore, the Investigation will be also focused on scientific evidences of existence of Dark Matter. Different galaxies' rotation speeds and mass will be examined in order to find the correlation between them. To assist the work and exploration of the topic, several programs, written by me in programming languages will be used as demonstration and visual representation of the investigated topic.
