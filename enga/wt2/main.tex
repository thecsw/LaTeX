% -------------------- HOOK ------------------------------
What if I tell you that all pictures in your house have a hidden camera in it, would you believe me? What if I tell you that you are being watched all the time without you knowing, would you believe me?  What if I tell you that all the lies you know are actually true and are called ``alternative facts'', would you believe me? I thought not. It is not a truth you would want to know. Unfortunately, it is happening rigth now. Nearly 70 years later, George Orwell has predicted our time with his classic dystopian novel - ``1984''. Here, an important question arises - ``If the text had been written in a different time or place or language or for a different audience, how and why might it differ?'' \\

% -------------------- INTRODUCTION ------------------------------
First of all, in order to talk about how the novel might differ in another timeline, we should understand the difference between the year ``1984'' was published - 1949 and the year that we live in right now - 2018. 1949 year was quite a rough year for the whole world. World War II has just ended. Whole Europe was in ruins. The relationships between the world countries has never been more intense. This unfortunate turn of events and cicumstances have led George Orwell to write his epic novel ``1984''. In his work, Arthur wanted to show the public his concerns and the horrors of the totalitarian structure of governments and total control with propaganda. For his time, George Orwell was in the few first who used the genre of dystopian futures. In 1984" there is a device called ``telescreen'', which was a form of a TV but with a 24/7 camera in it that spied on the people near it. His ideas were fresh and unexplored, it was new. What about now?\\

% --------------------- BEGINNING OF 2018 ------------------------
Therefore, if 1984 had been written in 2018, it will differ a lot in terms of technology and tools of control. From now on, I will refer to the 1984's 2018 edition as 2053. Firstly, I would like to talk about how the buildings, architecture and environment would change. The standards of living and the architectural fashion has changed drastically. Instead of old building with rusty staircases and rotten walls like post-war period, I image that 2053 would have modern buildings that are made of glass. Shiny and new. I think it would be comparable to Apple's new headquarters.\cite{apple} The setting of 2053 will be more futuristic and appealing to eyes. Actually, the setting or the environment do not matter more than the events that are happening in the setting. \\
 
% ---------------------- SETTING ----------------------------------







In 1984, people and citizens of Ocenia were brainwashed and controlled by unstopping series of commands and falsy information just to control the workers even more. People were controlled and limited in actions by Big Brother. The government of Ocenia limited their citizens to a conditions that just ensured that a man gets just enough to survive and not to die of hunger or thirst. However, in the modern version, all people will not be on the line of poverty. All people will be relatively rich and well-balanced. Why is this so? To answer that, let's remember why Winston started to rebel, what happened so that sparkled the rebellious nature of a man? The inconsistencies in the whole political and economical system. They were told that they reached 5th 3 year plan in less than 2 years. But still, their food rations are the same and maybe less. They were told that the ration of chocolate has been increased but actually it has decreased. Smart people like Winston noticed this and understood that something is not right in the situation. In my new scenario, all people will be told the truth, they all will eat as much as they would want to. So, you would ask - ``How is this the modern version of 1984?'' I will tell you how.\\

The only thing and ``variable in the equation'' that matters here is the control. In 2053, people will be free to walk wherever they would want to, they will be able to use whatever they would want to, they will be able to work and relax whenever they would want to, but they will be under total control of the higher governemnt. In 2053, people have devices like smartphones and computers. If in 1984 people were forced to listen to propaganda and disinformation, in 2053, people will read the fake news, propaganda information willingly without them even knowing. Social media will be available to them. They will use it and receive the misinformation without them even knowing.\\


% --------------------- TECHNOLOGY ------------------------------
We should not miss the fact that the technology has advanced a lot during the last 69 years. Now, we have TVs in every house, cellular phones became widely available and an absolutely new technology was developed and implemented - Internet. Internet has changed the way we interact with devices, with people, it has changed the way we communicate and the way we live. It has chnaged our lives so drastically in a such short amount of time. Even George Orwell did not predict the technology. The idea of Internet, of interconnected devices around the world was not even thought about in the year 1949. I mention this, because if ``1984'' was published in our time, it would be sinful to not mention and use the Internet as the means of propaganda, instead of propaganda in the form of posters like in ``1984''.\\
