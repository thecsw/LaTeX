What if I tell you that all pictures in you house have a hidden camera in it, would you believe me? What if I tell you that you are being watched all the time without you knowing, would you believe me?  What if I tell you that all the lies you know are actually true and are called "alternative facts", would you believe me? I thought not. It is not a truth you would want to know. \\

1984 is a beautifully written novel by a true genius of his time - Eric Arthur Blair or more known to the public as George Orwell. In his work, Orwelll added a lot of new topic to discussion: physical control, the dangers of totalitarianism, control of information and history, and so much more. During his life, George Orwell was an English novelist, essayist, journalist and critic. He had experience in military journalism, he has seen the horrors of war and poverty, thanks to that, with his pen, he was able to transform the horrors of total contol and the fear of the future on paper. It is fascinating how during his time, in the late 1940s and early 1950s the novel made a such big impact because the idea and the genre was new. It was simultaneously interesting and terrifying. In the TIME article of February 4, 1946 \cite{time}, it can be seen how people of that time were terrified of what the future might look like. \\

69 years have already passed since George Orwell published his epic novel in 1949. Many things have changed, many viewpoints have transformed and many generations have passed. Interestingly, 1984 became one of the bestsellers of year 2016 \cite{bestseller}. This happened when White House's official, Ms. Conway called his colleague's statement about the president's inauguration as "alternative facts". This term was mostly used in Orwell's 1984 when because of history alter, fabcricated facts were called as "alternative facts" and the society in the dystopian novel believed these "facts". It is interesting to see how the writers of the past and foresee and predict the events in the future. Here arises new question, what if George Orwell's epic dystopian novel was written on in 1949, but in our days, in 2018. Instead of 1984, the dystopian novel would take place in Great Britain of 2049?\\
