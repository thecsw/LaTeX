\section*{Rationale}
After reading George Orwell’s dystopian novel “1984”, I went through a range of emotions and thoughts about the themes, motifs and ideas. This work became one of my all-time best dystopian novels.\\

During the reading of the book, we encounter a character named Syme, a language expert and Winston’s co-worker. From the conversation between Winston and Syme, we learn that he is currently working on the new edition of the Newspeak dictionary, the official language of Oceania. Nevertheless, what differentiates him from everybody else, he sees a bigger scope in a way that he knows why he is doing his job and what the party is trying to accomplish by it - by limiting the vocabulary size limit the way people think, and ban the thoughts that are against the party and Big Brother. \\

I have decided to write a diary of Syme as I felt that I was missing more information and story development for him, to understand why he vanished. Maybe because of the diary he kept? I considered diary as the best format to express his inner thoughts and suspicions. This will unveil Syme’s attitude towards the Party. In the diary, he will describe the routing of his day, illustrate some newspeak words, we can see the details of the conversation with Winston from another perspective and get a “fresh look” at the whole story. This means that in the diary we will relive the events from the book, but from another point of view, thus expanding our comprehension of the book by getting more objective view on the plot. In order for my diary entries to be authentic, I have a date on top of each entry, because in comparison with Winston, Syme was more intelligent and was keeping the track of the dates.\\

Every time I see or hear these words, it’s like an art to my eyes and music to my ears. My name is Syme Vein and I am a philologist. I work on Newspeak, the language of the future, the language of oppression and total control. This is the first entry of my diary, which is strictly prohibited here in Oceania; I might get killed if anyone discovers this diary, but I can’t let the world to not know the founders of the new world with Big Brother. I want to be remembered as a part of the better world. \\

As the founder of the new world, I want to introduce the idea of Newspeak that I have been working on. Newspeak is the revised version of Oldspeak that we have now. Imagine the world in the future where people cannot even think about rebellion or disobedience. People wouldn’t even have an idea about disloyalty or revolution, because the language itself won’t have these concepts. The future world, where everybody is loyal to the Party, everybody loves Big Brother, everybody knows me.

In the previous entry I talked about Newspeak. The final version of Newspeak will be published in 2050, sure I'll be dead by then, but my name will be there and I will make a valuable part of the Party. Today I improved these words:\\

\textbf{versificator} - writing machine that can write music and literature. Big Brother doesn't want our party members to cloud their minds with such things, because they can become disloyal a threat to the Party.\\

\textbf{x yp n quarter} - method of writing dates, where x stands for the since the Party has been ruling Oceania and n is the quarter of the year. With this date type, the duration of Big Brother's Party is the time.\\

\textbf{Vaporized} - being executed by our glorius Party into nothing. Becoming unperson. All traitors will be vaporized.\\

I'm not a traitor, I am the one who will improve Party, so I can have this diary and leave my legacy for the better good.\\

It was quite cold today. Interesting thing happened to me today. I made a conversation today with Winston Smith. I saw him in the chess club and I know that he works in Ministry of Truth in the department of history altering. Quite a good job if you ask me, alter past to suit the future. Party needs to erase facts and history and change it with new alternative facts, only in that way Big Brother and Party will thrive. During our conversation, I talked with Winston about Newspeak and how it will change the way people think and behave. At least what I can tell, he looked suspicious. Maybe he's a spy for Eurasia or even worse, Eastasia? I should keep an eye on him.\\

Today is the day, today is Hate Week. The moment in time, where we all can show our respect and appreciation about what Big Brother has done. It was as usual, the telescreen showed a hateful speech of the biggest traitor of Oceania – Emmanuel Goldstein. I thought about it and saw again what a genius our Big Brother truly is. Have you ever seen Emmanuel Goldstein excluding the hate week? Nowhere. I think that Party created Emmanuel Goldstein, so people can concentrate their hate and energy on one person, so the Party can control members. That's a genuis idea. And I noticed that one day we have war with Eastasia and a day later we have war with Eurasia, like we never had a war with Eastasia. That's why “War is peace”, because the only way to have peace is to have war and always switch. I should tell this to somebody, somebody with ranks way higher than mine, so they can appreciate my knowledge and promote me to higher instances. Also I should tell on Winston Smith, he looks suspicious. Yes, I should. I'll go to the local inner Party member – O'Brien.  Then I will get a promotion for sure, if I spot a traitor. I will go to him after the hate week.\\

For the past 5 days I have been looking after Winston. He was talking with other female party member for quite a while now.  She looks suspicious as Winston too. I don't like it. They can be a threat to out Party, to Big Brother and me. I knew it. They are traitors of the Party. I knew it since I spoke to Winston, when he gave me a suspicious look, I knew that something is not alright with him.\\

Today morning I went to O'Brien to tell him about my realizations about the Party quotes and most importantly, about Winston Smith. When I told him that Winston has been spending too much time with other party members and going out too often, O'Brien looked surprised and thanked me for all my hard work and investigation. He promised me that my work won't go unnoticed and that soon I will be in place, where there is no darkness. That sounds good, maybe office with everlasting lights or new apartment, where I can consume any amount of electricity I want. Whatever, that's good news, finally someone will appreciate my work and the capacity of my knowledge. Most importantly, he gave me a promotion, so tomorrow morning I need to go to the Ministry of Love to join the inner Party!  \\
